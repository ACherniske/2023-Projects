# Device Information
Wearable device for recording temperature and hmidity of air inside football gear

## Purpose
- **Initialize** and run a series of diagnostic tests to make sure it is working properly
- **Collect** temperature and humidity data
- **Record** data to a micro SD card once every minute
- **Compile** data into a table when connected to a computer after trial is complete
