# Temperature and Humidity Data Collection Device
Technical Coding and PCB Design for Engineering 100 First Design Session  

------------------------------------------------------------------

## About the Class

[**Engineering 100**](https://coursecatalog.bucknell.edu/search/?P=ENGR%20100)  

> Introduction to the study and practice of engineering through authentic design projects centered around a common theme. Project-based course focuses on the engineering design process, teamwork fundamentals, engineering ethics, and the development of both technical and professional skills. Permission of instructor required for non-first-year students.  

**COURSE GOALS**

 - *Develop* creative solutions for problems facing our world by applying engineering design principles, math and science, and data analysis in a sustainable manner. 
 + *Construct* an effective prototype or model utilizing appropriate technology and tools.
 * *Demonstrate* improved proficiency with “power skills” such as communication, teamwork, information literacy, and professional development.
 - *Employ* the NSPE code of ethics to examine ethical case studies and extrapolate principles for other situations.

## **Scenario**  

Energy use on campus might be significantly reduced if a means of remaining comfortable in hot
weather could be developed that would not require the use of refrigeration systems to cool large indoor
spaces. Cooing people might be more environmentally effective than cooling buildings (esp when the
buildings are below capacity). In this session, students will be challenged to design personal cooling
technologies that could reduce or eliminate the need for air conditioning on campus. The challenges on
campus are part of a more global issue that we hope to address as well.
